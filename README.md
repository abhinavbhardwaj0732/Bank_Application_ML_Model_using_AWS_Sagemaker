Developed a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will enroll for a certificate of deposit (CD).
In this Project, I have learned how to:

1.Create a SageMaker notebook instance

2.Prepare the data

3.Train the model to learn from the data

4.Deploy the model

5.Evaluate our ML model's performance
